// That is also tag but it don't split that functions which use it but edit parameters 
// U could let one member of tag(the default) like m using _ in the bellow example
tag DistanceUnit(f32) {
	cm { => me * 10^-2 },
	_m,
	km { => me * 10^3 }

jump :: (x: DistanceUnit) {
	print("Jumped ${x}m");
}

main :: () {
	jump(29: cm) // Jumped 0.29m
}


// compiler will convert it to be

jump :: (x: f32) {
  print("Jumped ${x}m")
}

main :: () {
